## Multiple Classifier Systems
### An approach to Activity Recognition

This project is an investigation proposed by Maria L. N. Rodrigues, UFPE, to obtain a Master Degree in Computer Science.

#### Abstract:

Smart homes can be defined as environments monitored by sensors that capture information executed in it. These sensors are responsible for measure the temperature of a room, the number of times a switch has been turned on, and so on. However, the data obtained in these scenarios may vary during or after the capture process. These variations are defined as noise and affect the interpretation of the data. Given the information obtained from the environment, machine learning techniques can use this knowledge to identify the activities performed and to predict future ones. This area of learning is named Activity Recognition. Recently, the Random Forest presented consistent results in Activity Recognition problems in noisy-free environments. To identify which techniques can be used in smart home noisy scenarios, this dissertation evaluated the use of Multiple Classifier Systems compared to performance obtained by Random Forest. The proposal is to investigate how these techniques perform on real-world datasets for activity recognition considering six noise levels: 0% to 50%. Experimental results have shown that the Dynamic Selection techniques are adequate to handle noisy environments, presenting stable results as the noise level increases.
